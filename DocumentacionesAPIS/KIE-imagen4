# Imagen4 Fast API Documentation

> Generate content using the Imagen4 Fast model

## Overview

This document describes how to use the Imagen4 Fast model for content generation. The process consists of two steps:
1. Create a generation task
2. Query task status and results

## Authentication

All API requests require a Bearer Token in the request header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Get API Key:
1. Visit [API Key Management Page](https://kie.ai/api-key) to get your API Key
2. Add to request header: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`

She wears an oversized, vintage band t-shirt (slightly worn, with the faintly cracked white text “KIE AI” across the chest) layered over a long-sleeved striped top, along with simple silver stud earrings. The lighting is soft, golden hour sunlight streaming through a slightly dusty window, creating lens flare and illuminating dust motes in the air. The background shows a blurred, cluttered bedroom with posters on the wall and fairy lights, rendered with a shallow depth of field. Natural film grain, a warm, slightly muted color palette, and sharp focus on her expressive eyes enhance the intimate, authentic feel."`

## Usage Flow

1. **Create Task**: Call `POST https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/jobs/createTask` to create a generation task
2. **Get Task ID**: Extract `taskId` from the response
3. **Wait for Results**: 
   - If you provided a `callBackUrl`, wait for the callback notification
   - If no `callBackUrl`, poll status by calling `GET https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/jobs/recordInfo`
4. **Get Results**: When `state` is `success`, extract generation results from `resultJson`
